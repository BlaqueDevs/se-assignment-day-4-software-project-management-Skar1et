# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is crucial because each project starts after a successful feasibility, and time factors into that. A deadline is met as agreed by the developer, shareholders, and sponsors, and keeping to that time shows efficiency and confidence in the developer and the project. 
Project managers can ensure that timeline are met by using certain software to track and manage the project's timeline.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Sometimes a project can be too expensive and lead to it being abandoned halfway. Ensuring cost control will make it so that every material needed for the project is catered for.
By calculating the total cost of building and running the project and also adding a little more in case of market change. 

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
AGILE
Very flexible, improved collaboration
Lack of predictability, risk of scope expansion
WATERFALL
Predictability, stability
Inflexible, lack of collaboration

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Choose Agile for exploratory projects which thrive in a collaborative environment and waterfall for projects with a fixed and well-defined
requirement with sequential workflow.
Eg. for the agile method, projects like software development and creating marketing campaigns are suited for it
    While for the waterfall method projects like construction with a fixed blueprint

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Some methods for ensuring quality assurance include code reviews and continuous testing. 
It is important to maintain high standards because it ensures reliability and builds your reputation.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
When a project's scope is defined, there's less room for mistakes and it helps the developer to achieve the goals he set out.
(WBS) is a hierarchical breakdown of a project into smaller manageable parts.
It is useful because it makes it easier to accomplish a project when its goals are broken down into bits. The project is better actualised and 
is accomplished one step at a time.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed project schedule helps you create a clear timeline, organize your tasks and allocate your resources judiciously.
The Gantt chart helps because it creates a clear visual timeline of your project.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My software aims to solve the problem of un-free peer counselling apps where people share their experiences and talk about them. 
It is significant because as a YA myself, it is very important for me to find a circle where I can have honest conversations with
strangers and have a connection with them

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
it will help me to be able to visualize the parameters of the problem and create practical solutions for them.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
It will enable people to connect and match them with others on the platform who have similar problems. like with algorithm match-ups.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
A random bar that helps in randomizing your peer suggestions and a text recognition feature that recognizes the use of foul or alarm-raising words.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
There is a substantial data that shows and proves the rapid decline of mental health among YA and teens.

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
It can help me decide on how recipient my target audience will be to the software and what common features are more popular with them.
